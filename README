# Sync an iTunes playlist to your android phone

* Create a playlist (preferably named "Android") in iTunes. Put all the Music you want on your Android phone into this playlist
* Connect your Android via USB and activate the Flash storage mode
* run `ruby sync.rb`. This copies all items from the playlist to your Android (by default, it copies to /Volumes/droid/media/audio/itunes, as this is the setup on my computer
